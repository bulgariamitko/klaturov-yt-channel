## About Me

I'm currently focused on leveraging LLM CLI tools, such as Claude Code, to build and deploy apps efficiently.

Previously, I was deeply involved with FlutterFlow, where I served as a moderator, issue tracker, and beta tester. In 2023, I was honored to be recognized as a FlutterFlow Ambassador.

With a strong background in PHP, JavaScript, and Dart, I bring solid experience in both web and mobile app development. My journey with FlutterFlow allowed me to contribute to the community's growth, provide feedback, and help others master the platform—an experience that continues to shape how I approach modern development with AI-driven tools today.
