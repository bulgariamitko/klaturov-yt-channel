# Dimitar Klaturov - YouTube Channel Resources

Welcome to the official repository for my YouTube channel! This repo contains code samples, project files, and resources from my videos.

## About Me

I'm currently focused on leveraging LLM CLI tools, such as Claude Code, to build and deploy apps efficiently.

Previously, I was deeply involved with FlutterFlow, where I served as a moderator, issue tracker, and beta tester. In 2023, I was honored to be recognized as a FlutterFlow Ambassador.

With a strong background in PHP, JavaScript, and Dart, I bring solid experience in both web and mobile app development. My journey with FlutterFlow allowed me to contribute to the community's growth, provide feedback, and help others master the platform—an experience that continues to shape how I approach modern development with AI-driven tools today.

## Channel Focus

My content explores:
- Building apps with LLM CLI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
- Modern development workflows powered by AI
- FlutterFlow tips, tricks, and best practices
- Web and mobile app development
- PHP, JavaScript, and Dart tutorials
- Real-world project builds and deployments
